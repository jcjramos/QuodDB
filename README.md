# QuodDB
This is my "old" Symbian OS C++ based application.

Description:
QuodDB is a generic database application aimed at mobile devices.  As a database it allows you to store information in a organized way related to the most diverse subjects – for example your business clients or suppliers or your personal music collection or book collection, even your appointments or general contacts.  There are of course other applications that allow you to keep information, but the greatest advantage of QuodDB is that it is completely configurable – you can store whatever you want the way you want it.
